### 💔 **"The Last Letter"**  

In a quiet town, where the sunsets painted the sky with gold and crimson, **Ayaan** and **Sara** lived a love story that many envied. Their laughter echoed through coffee shops, and their dreams were sketched across late-night conversations.  

They met on a rainy afternoon, both seeking shelter under the same awning. Ayaan, with his quiet charm, and Sara, whose laughter could light up any room, seemed destined for each other. **For years, they were inseparable.**  

But sometimes, love isn’t enough.  

As time passed, **life’s cruel unpredictability crept in**. Ayaan received a job offer abroad—a dream he had worked for all his life. Sara, tied to her family and her mother’s failing health, couldn’t leave. They promised they would find a way.  

But **distance changes things**. The calls became fewer. The texts turned cold. Misunderstandings grew like walls between them. They stopped sharing their days, their thoughts, their fears.  

And then, **one evening**, a letter arrived at Sara’s doorstep.

> **“My dearest Sara,**  
>   
> I thought distance wouldn’t matter. I believed that love, our love, would conquer it. But some nights here, in this new city, I feel like I’ve been running after dreams I no longer recognize.  
>   
> I keep thinking about the small things—your love for poetry, the way you smiled when it rained, our late-night walks when the world seemed to stand still.  
>   
> But I also see how we’ve grown apart. How our worlds are no longer the same.  
>   
> I will always love you, Sara. But maybe our story was meant to be a chapter, not the whole book.  
>   
> **– Ayaan**”

Sara read the letter again and again, her tears blurring the words. The city outside continued as usual—cars honking, people laughing—but **her world had stopped**.  

She folded the letter carefully and placed it in the old wooden box where she kept all their memories—movie tickets, photographs, and the dried flower he once gave her.  

That night, as the rain tapped against her window, **she realized some goodbyes don’t come with closure.**  

Some loves don’t fade; **they just live in the quiet corners of the heart—untouched but unforgettable.**

💔 **Sometimes, the saddest love stories are the ones where love still exists, but life has other plans.**
